# Adventures in Space Arcade

A collection of arcade-style games built with Pygame.

## Games

### 1. Adventures in Space
In the year 2157, humanity's insatiable curiosity led you to the far reaches of space. As an elite Space Defense pilot, you patrol the dangerous Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter. But something's wrong - these aren't normal asteroids. They're moving with purpose, threatening Earth's outposts.

Your mission: Defend our space territory using your advanced Nerf-based weapon system. The deeper you venture into space, the faster and more unpredictable the threats become.
